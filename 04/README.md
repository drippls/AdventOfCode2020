<h1 align="center">Day 4: Passport Processing</h1>

## Part 1
### Breakdown:
- It's beneficial hacking time!
- Passport data is separated by spaces and newlines
- Blank lines are used to separate passports
- There are 8 fields needed to make a passport valid
- The cid field is optional
- Count the number of valid passports
- I think the hardest part will be cleaning up the data
